Marketing research team: 
1.	they have created a list of items from wide variety after doing extensive research on focused group participant to see what they like to buy more. So, they can get most popular items on the list.

Developer:
1.	As a developer I am required to build an app which displays series of three images at a time and allow users to click on one they like to purchase more. 
2.	Once users click 25 times, app should be able to store those clicks, calculate and visually display the resulting data to the users.
3.	I am not allowed users to click more than 25 times 
4.	I also need to show percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was displayed 

Focused User Groups:
